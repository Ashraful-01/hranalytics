Hi there, 
here I have done a power BI project called HR Analytics.

HR Data Analysis: Analyzed HR metrics, such as employee turnover, engagement, and performance data, to provide insights into workforce trends and areas for improvement.

Dashboard Creation: Designed and developed an interactive dashboard that visualizes key HR metrics, enabling data-driven decision-making for HR teams.

Data Cleaning and Preparation: Processed and cleaned raw HR data to ensure accuracy and reliability of insights displayed in the dashboard.

Insights and Reporting: Presented actionable insights to stakeholders, helping them understand patterns and make strategic decisions based on HR data.
